# Databricks Project: Employee Attrition Analysis

## Problem Statement
Employees are the backbone of any organization, and an organizationâ€™s performance heavily depends on the quality of its workforce. Employee attrition presents several challenges:

1. **Costly**: Training new employees is expensive in terms of both money and time.
2. **Loss of Experience**: Losing seasoned employees affects institutional knowledge.
3. **Productivity Impact**: Attrition disrupts workflows and reduces efficiency.
4. **Profit Impact**: Declines in productivity and efficiency ultimately impact profitability.

## Business Questions
To address these challenges, we aim to answer the following questions:

1. **What factors contribute most to employee attrition?**
2. **What measures should the company take to retain employees?**

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

1. **Age Analysis**  
   - Determine the age range of employees most likely to leave the organization.

2. **Department Analysis**  
   - Analyze attrition rates by department to identify high-risk areas.

3. **Marital Status**  
   - Understand how marital status correlates with attrition.

4. **Attrition by Education**  
   - Explore the relationship between educational qualifications and attrition rates.

5. **Attrition by Environment**  
   - Investigate workplace environment factors influencing employee attrition.

6. **Other KPIs**  
   - Additional metrics that may impact or explain attrition trends.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Databricks**: Cloud-based platform for big data processing.
- **Spark SQL**: Powerful query engine for structured and semi-structured data analysis.
- **Python**: Programming language for additional data manipulation and visualization.

## Project Workflow
1. **Data Collection**  
   Import employee data into Databricks for analysis.

2. **Data Cleaning**  
   Process the dataset to handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   Analyze the KPIs listed above using Spark SQL queries.

4. **Insights and Recommendations**  
   Derive actionable insights and provide recommendations to reduce attrition.

## Outcomes
By addressing the business questions and analyzing KPIs, the project aims to help the organization:
- Identify the primary causes of attrition.
- Formulate strategies to retain employees.
- Minimize costs associated with hiring and training new staff.
